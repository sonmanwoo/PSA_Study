# This code is supporting information from the published article, "Computational-cost-efficient surrogate model of vacuum pressure swing adsorption for CO separation process optimization" Separation and Purification Technology (2022).
# DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.seppur.2022.121827

# The code was implemented in Python Environment 3.7.9 using two library packages: PyCaret, and Optuna.
# - PyCaret for automated machine learning.
# - Optuna for single/multi-objective optimization.

# The code of the first-principle mathematical model is developed by the gPROMS, commercial software for Chemical Process Design, and will be not disclosed here.
